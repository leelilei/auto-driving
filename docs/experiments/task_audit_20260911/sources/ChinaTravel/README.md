  <h1>[ICLR'26] ChinaTravel: An Open-Ended Travel Planning Benchmark with Compositional Constraint Validation for Language Agents</h1>
</center>

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

ChinaTravel is a real-world travel-planning benchmark for language agents. It
combines structured sandbox data, natural-language requests, executable DSL
constraints, commonsense validation, and preference-based scoring.

## 🏆 News

### TPC@IJCAI 2026

ChinaTravel was selected as the official benchmark for the Travel Planning
Challenge at IJCAI 2026. The challenge focused on agentic systems for practical,
constraint-rich travel planning. See the
[official competition website](https://chinatravel-competition.github.io/IJCAI2026/).

### TPC@IJCAI 2025

ChinaTravel was selected as the official benchmark for the Travel Planning
Challenge at IJCAI 2025. The challenge invited language agents to solve
real-world travel-planning tasks under complex constraints. See the
[official competition website](https://chinatravel-competition.github.io/IJCAI2025/).

### TPC@AIC 2025

ChinaTravel also supported the Travel Planning Challenge at AIC 2025. The
competition setup, metrics, submission format, and evaluation environment are
retained in the [competition archive](TPC@AIC2025/readme.md).

## 📝 Changelog

### 2026.08

The 2026.08 release is the maintained post-competition version of ChinaTravel.
It consolidates the benchmark, evaluator, bilingual environment, and data
tooling developed during and after TPC@IJCAI 2026:

- OpenAI-compatible model runtime supporting Chat Completions and the Responses
  API;
- explicit Chinese and English query/sandbox selection through `--lang zh` and
  `--lang en`;
- hardened evaluation for entity grounding, activity chronology, transport
  validation, meal counting, hard-logic execution, invalid-plan scoring,
  deterministic data loading, and cached evaluation;
- modular synthetic-query generation with a constraint catalog, controllable
  sampling, independent audit, and query-only release export;
- Chinese-to-English DSL/query translation with rule and LLM audit, selective
  repair, conservative re-audit, and human-adjudication workflows;
- reproducible export of canonicalized English sandbox data, synchronized query
  and sandbox releases on Hugging Face and ModelScope, and release checksums;
- repository-relative, Git-ignored `artifacts/` outputs for portable local
  workflows.

Competition-only generated datasets and private test splits are distributed
separately. API credentials and local model outputs are not included in the
repository.

### 2025.09

- Published the champion solution of the TPC@IJCAI 2025 DSL track. We thank
  [@evergreenee](https://github.com/evergreenee) for the contribution.

### 2025.06

- Fixed commonsense-evaluation error collection.
- Fixed the pure-neural agent pipeline.
- Fixed Hugging Face dataset loading.
- Improved exception handling in syntax verification.

### 2025.05

- Updated logs for the latest version.
- Published the TPC evaluation code.

### 2025.04

- Added local query loading: a non-default `--splits NAME` value resolves to
  `chinatravel/evaluation/default_splits/NAME.txt`, whose lines identify the
  query files to load.
- Published a detailed constraint classification in the
  [evaluation documentation](chinatravel/symbol_verification/readme.md).
- Introduced the LLM-modulo baseline with a ground-truth symbolic verifier,
  based on *Robust Planning with Compound LLM Architectures: An LLM-Modulo
  Approach* and its
  [reference implementation](https://github.com/Atharva-Gundawar/LLM-Modulo-prompts).
- Added local inference support for Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-4B.

## 📦 Data Releases

| Resource | Hugging Face | ModelScope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Query dataset | [LAMDA-NeSy/ChinaTravel](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LAMDA-NeSy/ChinaTravel) | [Cbphcr/ChinaTravel](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/Cbphcr/ChinaTravel) |

The ModelScope repositories mirror the official Hugging Face query and sandbox
releases. Both query repositories provide the Phase 1 splits and the complete
2,000-query `TPC2026_phase2` config, including its 100-query `competition_test`
split.

## 🚀 Installation

Python 3.12 or newer is required by `pyproject.toml`.

With `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or with Conda and pip:

```bash
conda create -n chinatravel python=3.12
conda activate chinatravel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the official bilingual sandbox from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LAMDA-NeSy/ChinaTravel-Sandbox)
or [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/Cbphcr/ChinaTravel-Sandbox), and
place it as:

```text
chinatravel/environment/database/       # Chinese sandbox
chinatravel/environment/database_en/    # English sandbox
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `next` branch requires the current official sandbox release. It does
> not rewrite legacy English concept labels or POI aliases at runtime. Older
> `database_en` snapshots are unsupported and can produce different tool output
> or evaluation failures. Query, plan, and DSL entity names must match the
> installed sandbox exactly.

The requested language must exist locally. The standard run/evaluation scripts
default to Chinese for backward compatibility; pass `--lang en` explicitly for
English data.

## 🤖 Model Runtime

ChinaTravel accepts built-in aliases such as `deepseek`, `gpt-4o`, and
`glm4-plus`, or any model exposed through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-provider.example/v1"

# chat: OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions (default)
# responses: OpenAI Responses API
export CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_WIRE_API="chat"

# Optional provider-specific token field.
export CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_TOKEN_LIMIT_ARG="max_tokens"
```

Additional runtime variables include:

- `CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_MODEL`: default model when `--llm` is omitted;
- `CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_API_KEY`: key override before `OPENAI_API_KEY`;
- `CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_BASE_URL`: base URL override before `OPENAI_BASE_URL`;
- `CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_RAISE_ERRORS=1`: surface provider errors while debugging;
- `CHINATRAVEL_OPENAI_STRICT_TOOLS=1`: export strict OpenAI tool schemas.

Responses mode requires `openai>=1.66.0`. API keys must remain in environment
variables or ignored local configuration files.

## ▶️ Running Agents

Run an English or Chinese split:

```bash
python run_exp.py \
  --splits easy \
  --agent LLMNeSy \
  --llm provider/model-name \
  --lang en

python run_exp.py \
  --splits easy \
  --agent LLMNeSy \
  --llm provider/model-name \
  --lang zh
```

To expose oracle annotations to an algorithm that explicitly requires them:

```bash
python run_exp.py \
  --splits human \
  --agent LLM-modulo \
  --llm provider/model-name \
  --refine_steps 10 \
  --oracle_translation \
  --lang en
```

`--oracle_translation` exposes `hard_logic_py` and `hard_logic_nl`. Normal
participant-facing runs should omit it. Query files must use the current JSON
schema; when present, `hard_logic_py` must be a JSON list rather than a
string-encoded list.

Results are written under `results/<method>/`.

## 📊 Evaluation

Evaluate a generated result directory with the same language as the query and
sandbox data:

```bash
python eval_exp.py --splits human --method YOUR_METHOD --lang en
python eval_tpc.py --splits tpc_phase1 --method YOUR_METHOD --lang en
```

The TPC evaluator reports schema, commonsense, hard-constraint, FPR, and
preference metrics. Plans that fail required validity checks contribute zero to
the affected preference average; preference scores are not a bypass for an
invalid itinerary.

The hardened evaluator additionally enforces:

- database grounding for referenced entities and transports;
- chronological, non-overlapping activities and valid transport departure
  ordering;
- valid intercity transport placement and type-independent position handling;
- at most one hotel breakfast per day for the free-breakfast exception;
- exact entity names and canonical concept values from the installed sandbox;
- safe DSL execution and legacy apostrophe normalization.

## 🛠️ Agent Environment and Harness

`agent_env` exposes ChinaTravel through structured Python, CLI, HTTP, MCP, Chat
Completions tool-call, and Responses function-call interfaces.

```bash
python -m agent_env --lang en tools
python -m agent_env --lang en call attractions_keys '{"city":"Shanghai"}'
CHINATRAVEL_LANG=en python -m agent_env.mcp_stdio
```

For split-level harness execution:

```bash
cp agent_env/config.toml.example agent_env/config.toml
python agent_env/scripts/solve_script_with_harness.py
```

The tracked example defaults to English. The local `config.toml` is ignored
because it may contain provider credentials. See the
[Agent Environment guide](agent_env/README.md) for OpenCode, Codex, resume,
output, HTTP, and MCP details.

## 🧩 Synthetic Query Generation

The generator samples executable constraints only from already valid seed
plans, validates every candidate, validates the final combination again, and
writes an auditable manifest.

The examples below assume they are run from the repository root. Generated
files use the repository-relative, Git-ignored `artifacts/` directory; replace
it with any explicit output location when integrating the pipeline elsewhere.

```bash
python -m synthetic_query_generation seed-queries \
  --output-dir artifacts/synthetic/seed_queries \
  --num-records 100 \
  --lang en \
  --seed 2026

python -m synthetic_query_generation from-plans \
  --plans-dir results/seed_planner \
  --output-dir artifacts/synthetic/generated \
  --num-records 100 \
  --lang en \
  --seed 2026 \
  --copy-seed-plans

python -m synthetic_query_generation.audit \
  --dataset-dir artifacts/synthetic/generated \
  --expected-records 100 \
  --profile full \
  --lang en
```

Constraint families and individual template keys can be enabled, disabled, or
prioritized independently. See [Synthetic Query Generation](synthetic_query_generation/README.md).

## 🌐 Translation and Data Repair

The translation pipeline supports OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions APIs,
custom `base_url`, headers, model parameters, concurrency, and top-level
`extra_body` request fields. It combines deterministic checks with LLM review
and changes only records selected by the configured audit policy.

```bash
cp translation_api_config.example.json translation_api_config.json
export TRANSLATION_API_KEY="your-key"

python scripts/build_translation_assets.py
python scripts/audit_phase1_translations.py
python scripts/repair_phase1_translations.py
```

See [Translation and Audit Pipeline](scripts/TRANSLATION_PIPELINE.md).

For maintainers migrating a legacy English snapshot into the canonical release
format, the offline exporter can be run without modifying its source:

```bash
python scripts/export_fixed_sandbox.py artifacts/sandbox/ChinaTravel_sandbox_en_fixed \
  --archive artifacts/sandbox/ChinaTravel_sandbox_en_fixed.zip
```

Normal users should download the current Hugging Face or ModelScope release
instead. The archive produced by this maintenance tool contains a manifest,
change report, and checksums. See
[Fixed Sandbox Export](scripts/SANDBOX_EXPORT.md).

## ✅ Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python -m compileall -q chinatravel agent_env scripts synthetic_query_generation tests
```

The regression suite covers bilingual propagation, query resolution, evaluator
grounding and scoring, chronology, meal limits, performance caches, safe DSL
control flow, synthetic constraints, and translation repair.
